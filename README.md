# Binary Image Classification: Cats vs Dogs

This project implements a basic machine learning model for binary classification of images â€” distinguishing cats from dogs. It uses logistic regression with a custom implementation of forward/backward propagation and gradient descent.

## Project Overview

- Load and preprocess image datasets (training and test).
- Implement logistic regression from scratch (no sklearn or TensorFlow).
- Train the model on labeled images of cats and dogs.
- Evaluate model accuracy on test data.
- Predict on new images with a utility function.
- Visualize the learning curve (cost function) and example images.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
